This is the TODO list for "Pharo By Example", listing pending actions and current status of chapters.

# PHARO BOOK 1

## TO DO:

- Upgrade to new Pharo image (don't forget to check all the tests!)

- Incorporate Thomas Schrader's formatting suggestions? (See Regex/ToSh-Regex.tex)
- From: "symingz" <symingz@foxmail.com>

The correct way of determining message send order using these rules is like this.
First, use the rules to find the fully parenthesized equivalent of a given expression, 
e.g. '1 + 2 + x a' should equals '(1 + 2) + (x a)', not '((1 + 2) + x) a' or '1 + (2 + (x a))'.
Second, evaluate the fully parenthesized expression from left to right, from inside to outside.
What the book says is different, though. For example, when '(1 + 2) + (x a)' is evaluated, '+ 2' is be sent before 'a', but if we follow the book, the reverse will be assumed. If '+' and 'a' are replaced with some selector with side effects, following the book will lead to error.

## PLAN FOR RELEASING DRAFT CHAPTERS (Stef email 2010-08-24)

- Omnibrowser (should be ready since I think that you already read it)

- would be nice to take into account the remarks of one reader on the Syntax chapter because I wrote something wrong.

- would be nice to take into account the remarks of Hernan on the Exception chapter

- Profiling is done. We could add some sections at the end but this is good to release the chapters and get feedback

- Settings. We need two sections: one on how to script settings (I contacted alain) but again we could put it on the web since the last two sections are not necessary.

- Metacello nearly finished (mariano is writing the last bits)

- Gofer (Argh this is in french now I wonder if this is not any faster that you read the french and write the english because you will probably rewrite a part of my english)

## Regex
- stable, but some tests appear to be broken (in the PBE1 image)

## STATUS OF NEW CHAPTERS

* High priority for revision
+ Ready for public release
- Draft or less

## [SW Development]
+ Monticello -- pharo-ready -> STEF should check this?
- Debugging (outline only!) -> STEF
- Profiling -- Short draft. To be rewritten. -> ALEX * ANDREW
- Installer and other cool packages: STEF has a draft (should continue)

## [Frameworks]
- Magma (STEF ported the first version of the tutorial with the rights;
  to be rewritten with Chris Muller's help)
+ RegEx -- stable, stable, pharo-ready
+ OmniBrowser -- stable

## [Language]
+ Exceptions -- stable -- do we need to replace BlockContext by BlockClosure? What about MethodContext?
- Concurrency -- To do -> STEF
- Announcements (dependency mechanism) -- To do -> STEF (STEF wrote a first little draft)

## [Planned]
- Traits tutorial! -- STEF
- Programming Pier -> OSCAR
- We need a more practically oriented Morphic chapter.  The chapter in SBE 1 does not 	really show how to build a real GUI. [on -- from Mark Volkmann's comments]

- Reflective programming (may be something for the tutorial organized by Ralf on transformation):  STEF: example of ActTalk

## [Building other languages]
- New Compiler
- Tutorial on Smacc 
- Abstract Interpreter
- Composable Parsers (should ask adrian kuhn for his blog in Smalltalk) * 

- Idioms and Style -- OSCAR ?
	- explain why getters and setters violate encapsulation
- Inheritance/Idioms -- To do. -> ANDREW
- Common Errors -- To do. -> ???
